Turn Autoplay Off on YouTube
============================

When you're on the YouTube website, go to a video page (for example, `this one <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bz5FVfCF9uQ>`_) and then look for this interface item somewhere on the right side of the page:

Click the blue toggle button so that it looks like this:

With Autoplay disabled, you don't have to worry about another video automatically playing right after you've watched the current video.
