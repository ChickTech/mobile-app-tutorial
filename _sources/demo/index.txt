Demo
====

This is a demo that shows the kind of puzzle hunt you can create with App Inventor. Please download :download:`PuzzleHunt.apk` to your phone and install it. Work through each puzzle with your fellow team members. Soon you'll be building apps just like this one!

.. The puzzles in the demo are IceBreaker, WhatAmI, Calculation, Sequence, Doodle, ShortStory, WhoAmI. SignLanguage was cut because the phones we got produce .mp4 files that use an encoding not supported by web browsers.

After you've completed the puzzle hunt, you can go to http://chicktech.pythonanywhere.com/groups to see the answers your team submitted.

After you've completed all the chapters of the tutorial, feel free to come back to this page and check out :download:`PuzzleHunt.aia`, which is the project that implements the demo.
