Installation
============

You only need to install one app on your Android device. Use the Google Play app to download and install `MIT AI2 Companion <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion3&hl=en>`_. If your phone doesn't have Google Play, go to `this page <http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-wifi.html>`_ and download the APK file directly.

That's it! You're ready to :doc:`start creating your first mobile app </the-basics/index>`.
