=====================

todo:

- Verify all these steps on someone else's computer
- Add more detail about entering account credentials?

The following steps are based on the official instructions found `here <http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/other/genymotion.html>`_. We've streamlined the steps a little bit so you can just read our version.

#. Create a Genymotion account by filling out `this form <https://www.genymotion.com/#!/auth/account-creation>`_.
#. Download the Genymotion binary from `this page <https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download>`_.
#. Install Genymotion by running the binary.
#. Start up Genymotion and enter your account credentials.
#. Click on the ``Add`` button to add an Android Virtual Device.
#. On the ``Android version`` dropdown, choose "5.#.0" or whatever is the latest version of Android.
#. From the ``Available virtual devices`` list, select "Google Nexus 5". Click the ``Next`` button a couple times to get through the installation wizard, then click ``Finish``.
#. Verify that "Google Nexus 5" appears under the ``Your virtual devices`` list.
#. Start the Android Virtual Device by double-clicking on it.
#. Download `MIT AI2 Companion APK file <http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/companions/MITAI2Companion.apk>`_ to your computer.
#. Install the MIT AI2 Companion by dragging its APK file into the window of the running Android Virtual Device.
#. Now you need to install App Inventor Setup on your computer. Go to `this page <http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/setup-device-usb.html>`_ and download the correct binary for your operating system.
#. Install App Inventor Setup by running the binary you downloaded.
#. Visit http://appinventor.mit.edu/test/. If everything has been properly installed, then you should see both these messages:

   - YES, aiStarter 2.3 is running!
   - YES, your phone is connected via USB!

Whew, that was a lot of work, but congratulations on finally getting through it! Now you're ready to :doc:`start creating your first mobile app </the-basics/index>`.
